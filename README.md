## Data Structures & Algorithms

This is the draft one of this entire course. At this point, I am not focused much on the delivery or the ordering & interrelationship between concepts, but rather more on the concepts. I WANT TO JUST GET THINGS DONE AS OF NOW. 

The idea is to create a big course and then divide it into digestible well-ordered parts where each part contains content of about 10 hrs. and could be easily covered in a week => 5 day teaching and hands-on bootcamp + 1 day revision + 1 day evaluation.

For some reason, I don't know why, but I want to create this course in three programming langauges, in order to give users the flexibiltiy to choose whatever language they prefer. The languages that are on top my head are: 
* C++
* Java
* Python

But I am not sure if I will be able to pull this off. Let's see! 

ALL THE BEST TO ME!
